!Gembox.jpg!


h3(#what). What

Gembox is a very simple web based application for browsing your local ruby gems. It uses "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com to provide a pretty layer on your gem repository, so you can browse, find, and learn about your installed ruby gems.

h3(#why). Why

I'm currently obsessed with the idea that Sinatra can be used as a web interface for existing Ruby projects. What better Ruby project to prove it with then the omega-project, Rubygems.

h3(#usage). Usage

Once gembox is installed its very simple to start it up.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gembox
{% endhighlight %}

If all goes well, this will start gembox at:

"http://localhost:5678":http://localhost:5678

At this point the features are pretty limited. You get:

* some basic stats
* search for gem by name
* some views of all your installed gems
* ability to browse by version
* see a pretty gemspec
* browse the included files
* jump to the file in github (if the gem's homepage == github)

Some features that I'd like to do (or you can with a simple 'fork you'):

* make this a full on gem server
* install gems in the browser
* better support for github linkage
* links to rdoc and auto rdoc generation
* easy daemonizing + running on a named local host like: http://localgems

Another enterprising soul has done the work of converting gem server to a sinatra app:

"http://github.com/jnewland/sinatra-rubygems/tree/master":http://github.com/jnewland/sinatra-rubygems/tree/master

<div class="warning">
  <p>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not run this on a public web-server right now. It currently contains some SUPER unsafe code (aka running arbitrary code off the filesystem)</p>
</div>

h3(#dependencies). Dependencies

Gembox requires:

* rubygems >= 1.3.1
* haml >= 2.0.9
* sinatra >= 0.9.1
* activesupport >= 2.2.2
* mislav-will_paginate >=2.3.7
